It is no use complaining.
I didn't think that Tom would ever forgive Mary for doing that.
What happened in the meeting?
You have no right to throw me out.
We walked for about 6 kilometers.
Why are you here?
We saw Tom.
I can neither write nor read.
I want to introduce you to her.

You should always apologize in person.
How good a drummer is Tom?

I can't talk.
I teach French at a high school.
You don't need to do that right away.
I've been thinking about you all day.
We're fortunate.
Please don't interfere.

Tom couldn't find his keys.
I can't play tennis very much.
Nothing happened after all.
Crazy!
I still think about him all the time.
Mary is a stubborn woman.
He gave me a promise to come here at five.
I figured I could trust Tom.
I can't give them that.

I need a new car.
They aren't going to help him.
I do not want any milk at all.
Sorry, I can't eat that - I'm diabetic.
He came after everybody had come.
Tom elbowed his way through the crowd.
Everyone ate the same thing.
You're very nice.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Tom was listening intently.
That was the end of the class.

I am going to the post office.
He mustered up the courage to propose to her.
I cannot go. For one thing I have no money.

Can I have your autograph please?
The man was ashamed of being born poor.
Have you already met each other?
I need something smaller.
We postponed the event.
I've gone to Boston twice.
I had a dream about him.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
It's not just a theory.
I'm going to speak to her.
Watch.
I'm going to check upstairs.
Why not both?
You'd better shut the door.
Very many people know him.
That's all going to change.
I'm not satisfied.
For centuries Cracow was the capital of Poland.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary needs to do that.

How did she solve the problem?
In Haiti, there was a large earthquake.
Does anyone know why Tom isn't here?
That's a huge relief.
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
Do you know my father?
The trains are less frequent at night time.
He's unstoppable right now but the question is how long he can remain at the pinnacle of his career.
Tom intervened.
Tom could've and should've helped Mary.
I can't believe what just happened.
Where did you buy those oranges?
How barbaric!
If he hadn't wasted time, he'd be finished by now.
Mine is not so good as yours.
He already regretted when I'd only said it.
He’s not ashamed of the fact that his father is poor.
Keep the toilet clean.
