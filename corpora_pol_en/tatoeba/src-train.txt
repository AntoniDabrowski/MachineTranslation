We need some more coffee.
I'm bad.
What are you doing in my room?
Do you prefer mornings or evenings shifts?
Just tell us the truth.
Culture destroys languages.
Oh, a bath, please.
This is an important step.
Tom decided to learn all he could about computers.
There's something I should tell you.
The pup snapped at my hand.
Thank you for helping me to do my homework.
He will pass the upcoming examination.
Do you watch TV?
It is our policy not to give out personal information.
Could you reduce the price a little?
We fixed the price at $15.
What did he tell you about me?
He made him cry.
I wanted to speak in French with Tom.
Mary told me that she thought Tom was asleep.
Tom took care of our dog while we were in Boston.
Love cannot be forced.
Is it a crime to love someone?
This is something I need to do alone.
We have to turn in the reports on Monday.
We only kissed.
I've heard it said that it's harder to please a woman than to please a man. I wonder if that's true.
They can't see Tom.
I arrive at work at 8:30.
And if I were gay, would that be a crime?
Tom seems to be having a little difficulty in math.
Keep hold of my hand if you're afraid.
No thank you, I'm pregnant.
He arrived first.
Tom neither reads nor writes.
He is good at rugby.
She changed the subject.
Why don't we check?
Tom, who was always early, was there already.
He asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
You're joking!
Let's share this money between us.
He wears pajamas.
I didn't know that Tom was back.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
I think this will work.
Tom grinned.
I wouldn't mind if Tom borrowed my car.
I was wondering when you'd get back.
I don't have an opinion either way.
He's at church right now.
It's likely to get cold tonight, so you may need an extra blanket.
He completely failed to understand why she got angry.
I vacuumed the car.
Some politicians are wolves in sheep's clothing.
Nothing but a miracle can save her now.
There are islands in the sea.
She opened the window, even though I told her not to.
Most people won't notice that.
Was your family with you last month?
This system worked well until the 1840s.
Bring something to drink.
Someone betrayed us.
I've got bigger problems.
I thanked Tom for his time.
How smart!
Let's drive to the lake.
I want to have a talk with you.
The temperature in different places can vary greatly at the same time of year.
I didn't realize what I was doing.
I'd have succeeded if I'd tried harder.
Good luck on your test.
Bring me something to eat.
We're still eating.
Close your eyes, and count to ten.
Father is cooking dinner in the kitchen now.
I sent a message to her.

Did Tom say anything about me?
Let's play football!
I need a bath.
Ask anyone.
We're studying French.
I need one more.
I looked for someone to take her place.
I have a fish bone stuck in my throat.

Come round whenever you want.
The bullets bounced off the side of the armoured car.
I'm in the car.
I really didn't understand.
Be discreet.
He asked for some money.
Do you really think I should marry Tom?
I waited for the answer but nobody answered.
What did you say? I can't hear you.
I really tried.
I'm the only one here right now.
We appreciate your kind advice.
Don't do anything yet.
Tom didn't want to go back home.
It's a very small town.
I loved going to the beach.
These are pretty good.
Look at your hands.
It was at the front door.
Tom didn't want Mary to call him all the time.
There are several exits.
Tom said he'd like to be a fish.
Tom can do a lot of things that I can't do.
Mary loved Boston.
Could you help me wash the dishes?
The church is there.
Let's get a picture of us with the sea in the background.

I shouldn't smoke.
You seemed to be busy.
Tom has just come home.
Some Arabs are Christians.
Unless I miss my guess, he is forty.
You must've been wrong.
Don't stop!
It's fall now.
He has changed.
If you should do that, you would come in for severe criticism.
Enjoy your stay in Boston.
You're prepared.
These days more and more young people talk to their elders on even terms.
I wasn't indiscreet.
I try.
Tom won't get scared.
I can't face the truth.
I don't usually wait for anybody.
He's an old timer.
Would you like some advice?
The police will be carrying out an investigation of this crime.
Tom was planning on killing someone.
We went to the museum.

It turned out that we received a million dollars.
We may be too late.
Tom thought Mary would be present at today's meeting.
Four of a kind.
Why did you open the door?
He gripped the tennis racket tightly.
Everybody in the room let out a sigh of relief.
Bravo!
This sounds very interesting.
If looks could kill, I'd be dead by now.
She is not as young as she looks.
Would you two knock it off with the loud noise? I'm trying to sleep.
I need a new laptop.
Tom doesn't want you to know.
Why is life so full of suffering?
I felt like I was intruding.
Help me with this file cabinet.
I wish you all good luck.
My favourite day of the week is Monday.
I'll cook.
She did her homework.
Every morning, the neighbour's rooster woke us.
I obeyed the rules.
I didn't pay.
Where's the proof Tom ever did that?
"How old are you?" "I'm 16 years old."
Which do you like better, cycling or jogging?
Can you move?
What's the commotion?
Do you trust her?
Should I order this to the parcel locker or as a home delivery and COD.
What time does the next train to Boston leave?
Mary is a very good skater, isn't she?
Don't ever do that again.
He told me his life's story.
This book contains a lot of photos.
David has so many girlfriends that he can't remember all of their names.
Tom did that last year.

How much does the job pay?
Can you think of any reason why Tom wouldn't want to do that?
The car is blue.
China is a huge country.
You shouldn't tease him.

Give it to me, please.
Tom is eager to go to Boston.
We need a new babysitter.
Mary ran.
Boil one egg.
I appreciate your invitation, but...
She threw a suspicious glance at him.
This is the most delicious pizza I've ever eaten.
We're really happy.
