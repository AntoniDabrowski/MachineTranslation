Task description:
Think about questions for which the answer is the title of some 'document' (it could be a Wikipedia article or a dictionary definition). Example:

*What is the name of a two-wheeled vehicle propelled by leg power?*

Your program should match this question with a definition:

*A vehicle that has two wheels, one behind the other, a steering handle, and a saddle seat or seats and is usually propelled by the action of a riderâ€™s feet upon pedals.*

and answer '*bicycle*'

Use some combination of sparse and dense retrieval.
