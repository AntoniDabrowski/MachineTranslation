The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won \u2019 t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn \u2019 t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise .
