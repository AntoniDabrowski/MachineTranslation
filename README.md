# MachineTranslation
A machine translation model based on OpenNMT


## Task description:

Train your own Polish-English machine translation system, and compare its quality with the one from HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/models). You have to create the parallel corpus of pairs of sentences from these languages, choose the architecture (consider using OpenNMT), and train the model.

You can use any data to train the model. Consider the following sources:

tatoeba.org
https://clarin-pl.eu/index.php/zasoby/
Our main objective is to obtain the Polish versions of the following dialog corpora:

[1] https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/dailydialog
[2] https://github.com/facebookresearch/EmpatheticDialogues
[3] https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html
Teams doing this task are kindly asked to prepare translation of some parts of corpora [1], [2], [3] (using Google Translate and DeepL APIs). Part of this mini-corpus will be used as additional training data, part of this corpus will be used as a test set.
